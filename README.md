# LongestCommonSubsequence

Java object to align two sequences and discover their Longest Common Subsequence.

Currently:
- Supports a wide array of alignment score matrices for global alignment.
- Supports different SequenceAlign constructors for different matrix score files and LCSFinder algorithms.

TODO:
- Add local alignment
- Add edit distance
- Add overlap alignment
- Add fitting alignment
- Experiment with A* search to optimize search time
